###How To Compile and Run
	+ Download files and open onto eclipse.
	+ In order to gain access to all of the images and configuration files to run, one must manually add these images and configurations into the images and config folders respectively.  After downloading the repository, these folders are available in the saved location.
	+ After all configuration files and image files are loaded, press run and the sim city should appear. 
	+ Within the program, there are three windows, the Sim City, the Log, and window for the inside of buildings.  
	+ This window for the inside of buildings is activated by pressing the different buildings within the Sim City.  Pressing on a building will show the inside of a building.  
	+ Within the Sim City there are controls in order to run four scenarios.  The four scenarios are as follows: 
	1.Regular day with Timer
 	2. One visitor visits all of the buildings 
 	3. This third scenario runs with cars and bus as part of the scenario with a visitor as well. 
 	4. The last scenario runs the weekend.  The difference in the scenario of the weekend is that all banks are closed and this is the day that people relax. 
 	

	+In addition to the selection of of a scenario, there is a place where people may be added to the city as well.  In this area, the five areas to choose from would be the name, money value, role, housing option, and transportation preference.  
	+The name dictates what Icon the individual walks around with on the map, as it will be the first letter of their name.  Additionally, it allows one to scroll down the person list and choose the option of whether or not to track this individual on the map, which will make their icon green.  
	+The money value that is provided is how much money the individual will walk around the city with, as they pay to go to restaurants and markets.  In addition to this, this money can be used for transactions with the bank, such as deposit and withdrawl.  The purpose of this is to simulate real life interactions with money. 
	+The third is role, which is the role that they will take in the city in concerns to the profession that they hold. 
	+The housing option is where the individual will live in the city.  However there are limited spots in the city and they are as follows:
	
	In Scenario one there are three spots in houses available, as well as 3 spots in apartments.
	In Scenario two there are three spots in houses available, as well as 2 spots in apartments.
	In Scenario three there are three spots in houses available, but no spots in apartments.
	In Scenario four there are three houses available and 3 apartment spots available.
	
	+Lastly the last parameter within the instantiation of a person is the transportation preference.  This dictates how this individual gets to and from work.  The bus stop will pick them up at the bus stop closest to their house, and drop them off at the nearest bus stop to where they work.

	Missing Components
	Vehicles should behave appropriately at intersections.
	
	Routing behavior must show that agents don't bump into buildings, tables, etc.
	
	Enough vehicle traffic to show stopping/starting at intersections.
	
	Vehicles stop for pedestrians with right of way.
	
	P. Scenario: Vehicle accident
	
	Two vehicles collide.
	
	
	Q. Scenario: Vehicle hits pedestrian
	
	A vehicle hits a pedestrian.
	
	Then ... (you design it).
	
	Roads should have appropriate complexity [e.g. intersections with stop signs and/or signals]
	
	Role Switching 
	
	
	Overall a great team effort and we all collaborated on many parts of the project.  Much of this effort and collaboration cannot be outlined very specifically.  We all assisted each other in areas needed.
